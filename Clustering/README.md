# Question
The iris data set iris.txt contains 150 data points, each with four predictor variables and one categorical response. The predictors are the width and length of the sepal and petal of flowers and the response is the type of flower. The data is available from the R library datasets and can be accessed with iris once the library is loaded. It is also available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).

Use the R function kmeans to cluster the points as well as possible
