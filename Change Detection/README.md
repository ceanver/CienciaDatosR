1. Using July through October daily-high-temperature data for Atlanta for 1996 through 2015, use a CUSUM approach to identify when unofficial summer ends (i.e., when the weather starts cooling off) each year. That involves finding a good critical value and threshold to use across all years.

2. Use a CUSUM approach to make a judgment of whether Atlantaâ€™s summer climate has gotten warmer in that time (and if so, when).

You can get the data that you need from the file temps.txt
