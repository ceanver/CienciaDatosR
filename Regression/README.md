# Question
Using crime data from http://www.statsci.org/data/general/uscrime.txt (description at http://www.statsci.org/data/general/uscrime.html ), use regression (a useful R function is lm or glm) to predict the observed crime rate in a city with the following data:

M = 14.0 So = 0 Ed = 10.0 Po1 = 12.0 Po2 = 15.5 LF = 0.640
M.F = 94.0 Pop = 150 NW = 1.1 U1 = 0.120 U2 = 3.6
